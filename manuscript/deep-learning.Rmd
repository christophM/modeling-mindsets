# Deep Learning


* Special case of risk-based mindset
* It's own mindset because
  * transfer learning
  * feature learning
  * modularity
  * universe of its own. like only using lego to play.
  * Some people would only use neural network
  * universal function approximator
  * any ml model can be distilled into neural network
* Called deep learning instead of neural networks, because it's about how we learn about the world
* Optimization does not matter really
* especially works for images and text
* prediction-focused
*

## Neural Networks

* a bit about architecture


## Transfer Learning


## Advantages

## Limitations
