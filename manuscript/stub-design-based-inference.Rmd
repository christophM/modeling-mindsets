# Design-based Inference {#design-based-inference}

* Focused on sampling data representatively rather than complex modeling.
* Data population is finite; uncertainty about results is only due to sampling.
* Often combined with [Statistical Modeling](#statistical-modeling), especially [Frequentist Inference](#frequentist-inference).
