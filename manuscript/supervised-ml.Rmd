# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning is a sub-mindset of the machine learning or risk-minimization mindset.

<!-- what is supervised mindset -->
The supervised ML mindset is a risk-minimization mindset, where the goals is to minimize some loss function across data.
It shares all the goals presented in [chapter machine learning](#machine-learning).

<!-- why own mindset -->
But why is supervised ML it's own mindset, and not just one specific task of machine learning?
Supervised machine learning has one very clear distinguishing factor: It requires to have a ground truth for the prediction.
Unsupervised machine learning does things like clustering and outlier detection.
While we can express these problems as risk-minimization, we have no clue whether the clusters or outlier classification was correct.
And that makes a big difference.
I have met people who would not touch any unsupervised learning, since we don't know the true label.
So I would definitely say that supervised is it's own mindset.
And it's a big one with many people following it.

<!-- formula -->
If we want to express it mathematically, we take the loss minimization, but with a dedicated target variable $Y$:

$$\arg \min_{f} L(Y, X, f(X))$$

<!-- kaggle and competition -->
The machine learning mindset invites competition.
More than any of the other mindset can the goodness of the model be described by a single number: performance on unseen data.
That opens a whole world of competitions.
Truth to be told, there are other platforms that host competitions also for statistical models and such.
But for machine learning it's especially easy to create a leaderboard with automatic evaluation.

<!-- ml and automation -->
Machine learning, like none of the other mindset, lends itself to automation.
Due to this singular focus on optimization, we can automate much of it.
Computers are good at optimizing stuff.
We need humans for making assumptions like in Bayesianism and frequentism.
A human has to decide on causal graphs for causal inference.
Not so with machine learning.
This makes it a prime candidate for automating processes.
But it's also a weakness of the approach.
The mindless optimization leads to big flaws.
