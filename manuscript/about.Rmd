# What This Book is About

The book introduces many modeling mindsets: each presents a different perspective on how to see the world through data.
It's an introduction to each mindset: its *assumptions, central ideas, its relationship to other mindsets, and its strengths and limitations*.
The book is not about history and (formal) philosophy.
It's also not a full introduction to the mindsets.
After reading this book, you will not be a Bayesian, or any other type of modeler.
Modeling Mindsets can open the doors to new ways of thinking about modeling for you.
But there are other resources to explore what's behind each door -- an online course on machine learning, blog posts about about causal inference, a book about Bayesian inference, ...

## Who This Book is For

The book is for data scientists, statisticians, machine learner, quantitative researchers, ...
In short, for anyone who already has experience with modeling data.
This means you probably already know one of the mindsets.
Perhaps, like me, you studied frequentist statistics.
Or you may be a researcher who has learned to use Bayesian inference to analyze your data.
Or maybe you are a self-taught machine learner.
A little bit of math should not scare you off.
