how this book came about

some anecdotes from my life


You find many books and essays on

- frequentist vs. bayesianism
- ml vs stats
- causal vs. frequentist

Also when teaching happens, at least in my teaching I think different mindsets should have been made clearer.

For example, I think that distribution-free statistics is very different from likelihood-based mindset.
