# Example

* Don't put in the examples for the MVP of the book yet, but keep looking for good example
* TODO: Find an example that can be looked at from all mindsets.
* Something every-day-relatable that everyone can understand, so not complicated cell biology or so
* Something diverse enough that we can fit all mindset:
  * Example should allow different types of questions to be asked (prediction, parameters, ...)
  * Tabular, but also image data
* Should the example be hypothetical? Or maybe with real data and therefore real code?
* Real data and real code would, of course, be very attractive.
* For every mindset: Find the most simple analysis that shows all aspects
