# Visualization


Is visualization a modeling mindset?

Let's revisit what's a model:

* components
* relationships between components
* parameters

In the visualization mindset, the visualization itself is a model of the data.
The individual graphical elements (points, lines, bars, ...) are the components of this model.
The relationships between the components are displayed via attributes of these components (color, size, shape, coordinates on plot, ...).
Only the parameters are not important (except for some scaling of the figure and so on).
Especially since we often just display the raw data.

The mindset behind data visualization:

* We can understand the data best by visualizing it
* We don't put assumptions on how the data is distributed



## Relation to other mindsets

Quite orthogonal, and can extend other mindsets.

Often visualization is the  first and the last step.
First: Visualize raw data to form a mental model of the data, get some initial understanding.
