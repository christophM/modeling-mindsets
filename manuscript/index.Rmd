Statistics, machine learning, causal inference, Bayesianism, ...
There are many modeling mindset out there when it comes to learning from data about the world.

Sometimes people have just one of these mindset to approach all types of modeling problems.
But the best data modelers and data scientists have many of these mindsets.
They don't just model the world with the mindset they happened to grow up with.
But they pick the mindset that fits the job best.

This book serves as an overview of various mindsets.
Each modeling mindset has strengths and weaknesses, tasks it's good at, and tasks that are outright excluded for philosophical reasons.
This book invites to dive into these different modeling mindsets.
Broaden your horizon when it comes to modeling.
The book is the first step of becoming a jack-of-all-trades of creating models of the real world with data.
