<!-- TODO:

Write about how this book is unique:

- usually books/resources are about one mindset
- sometimes only comparing two: stats/ml, freq/bayes, ...
- parts of mindset are implicit in how community works
- lots of reading between the lines
- but this book makes it explicit and saves you years
-->

<!-- this book -->
Modeling Mindsets is an introduction to the many modeling mindsets that you can use to understand and predict your data.

<!-- Many mindsets available -->
Statistics, machine learning, causal inference, Bayesianism, ...
The best modelers, researchers and data scientists don't stubbornly stick to only one mindset.
The best choose the right mindset for the right data task.

<!-- but difficult to do so 
It can take years to grasp what a mindset is all about.
Why?
Learning about a mindset is often method-driven
But I don't think it has to take that long.

Forming this mindset is often implicit, and people really don't tell you.
-->

<!-- content -->
The book covers various mindsets, and each one gives you another superpower:
Statistical modeling, the foundation for many mindsets built on probability.
Frequentist inference as a decision-oriented tool.
Bayesian inference, a holistic probabilistic modeling approach.
Causal inference, a mindset that builds causality into your models.
Supervised machine learning, a mindset focused on prediction.
And many more.

<!-- this book -->
Modeling Mindsets gives an introduction to all these different mindsets.
The book is packed with intuition, memorable illustrations, and strengths and limitations for each modeling mindset.
Expand your horizons in modeling and become a jack-of-all-trades in learning from data.
