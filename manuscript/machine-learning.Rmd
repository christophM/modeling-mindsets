* Machine learning is a mindset concerned with making a computer "intelligent". 
* A good machine learning model solves a task well: external evaluation of task performance is more important than the internal validity of the model.
* Machine learning is an alternative meta mindset to [statistical modeling](#statistical-ml). 
* [Supervised machine learning](#supervised-ml), [unsupervised machine learning](#unsupervised-ml), [reinforcement learning](#reinforcement-learning), and [deep learning](#deep-learning) are specializations of the machine learning mindset.


<!-- motivational introduction -->
It's likely that you've used a machine learning product today.
Maybe you have asked your smart assistant to read out your schedule for today, used a navigation app to get from A to B, or checked your mostly spam-free e-mails.
In all of these applications, machine learning is used to make the product work: speech recognition, traffic jam prediction, and spam classification are just a few examples of what machine learning can do.

<!-- Artificial intelligence -->
Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with learning models directly from data.
The computer improves at a given task through "experience" which means learning from data.
The machine learning mindset doesn't tell you **how** the computer should learn from data.
For example, machine learner may use random variables, but they don't have to.
They can work on a prediction model where it is clearlt of defined when the model is correct, or they can work on clustering where the model is harder to evaluate. 
The models can be neural networks, decision trees, density estimators, statistical models and many more.
<!-- not it's own mindset  -->
Given this wide range of tasks, and without strict guidelines on how the computer must learn: Can we really say that machine learning is a distinct mindset?
To answer the question, let's first look at more specific mindsets within machine learning.
Machine learning is usually divided into supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.
Each of these subsets also represents a distinct modeling mindset: They involve a particular view of the world and of the relationship between the models and the world.
The [supervised machine learning](#supervised-ml) mindset frames everything as a prediction or classification problem and has a clear definition of what a good model is: when it generalizes well to new data.
In [unsupervised machine learning](#unsupervised-ml), the goal is to find patterns in the data.
The [reinforcement learning](#reinforcement-learning) mindset views the world as dynamic, in which an actor interacts with an environment guided by a reward.
In [deep learning](#deep-learning), all models are neural networks.
What are the commonalities between all these mindsets?
Is there a unified machine learning mindset?

<!-- yes, ml has core mindset -->
The machine learning mindset may not be as unified and principled as [statistical modeling](#statistical-modeling).
But all machine learning approaches have a few things in common.
Let's take a look at what makes a good machine learning model and how these models relate to the real world.

<!-- ml is computer-driven -->
Like all modeling mindsets in this book, machine learning is based on learning models from data.
As the name implies, machine learning focuses on the "machine", meaning the computer.
Machine learning is about the computer "learning" to solve tasks such as prediction, recommendation, translation, and clustering.
How is this different from the work what statisticians, who also rely on computers?
The motivation for using a computer differs between an archetypal statistician and an archetypal machine learner.
The statistician uses the computer out of convenience and necessity.
Modern statistics wouldn't be possible without the computer.
But the computer is not the starting point.
The starting point is statistical theory.
And the computer is only a tool to apply statistical theory to data. [^computational-statistics]
The machine learner, in contrast, starts with the computer.
The machine learner says, "We have this new thing, the computer. How can we get it do intelligent and useful things?"

<!-- algorithm-producing algorithm -->
Machine learning can be understood as a meta-algorithm:
An algorithm that uses data to produce machine learning models that are also algorithms.
From a programmer's point of view, machine learning is a paradigm shift:
Machine learning is just a way of "learning" an algorithm from data, rather than programming it directly. [^still-programmed]

<!-- ml is task-driven -->
In contrat to more insight-driven statistical mdoeling, machine learning is typically used to solve a task.
The task may be language translation, image captioning, classification, and so on.
The success of the model is measured by how well the task was solved using some type of metric.
In prediction and classification tasks, the machine learner measures the generalization error for new data.
Specifically, for a classification model, this could be the accuracy with which the model assigns classes correctly in a new data set.
In clustering tasks, success metrics usually measure how homogeneous the data points in the clusters are and how much the data differs between clusters.
This external focus is also reflected in the way machine learning research works:
Researchers invent a new machine learning algorithm and show that it works by comparing it to other algorithms in some task benchmarks.
The reason why the algorithm works well is often discovered in later scientific publications, if at all.

<!-- external vs intrinsic motivation -->
We can distinguish between external and intrinsic modeling motivation.
The motivation and evaluation of a machine learning model is external, based on task performance.
It's like judging food based on how it tastes.
Statistical modeling is intrinsically motivated.
The rationale for constructing the model is important.
It's like judging food not only by how it tastes, but also by the cooking process: did the chef use the right ingredients? Was the cooking time appropriate, and so on.


## Strengths

* Task-oriented and very practical.
* A job in machine learning potentially pays you lots of money.
* A computer-oriented mindset in a computer-oriented world. 
* Machine learning is predestined for automating tasks and building digital products.

## Limitations

* Not as principled as statistical modeling.
* A confusing amount of approaches with different motivations and technical bases.
* A model that works well in solving a task is not necessarily a good model for insights. A model that predicts diabetes well can be useful, but is less insightful than a statistical model that models diabetes risk explicitly and understandably.
* Often requires a lot of data and is computationally intensive.


[^computational-statistics]: There is a field called computational statistics, which is computer-oriented. But we are talking about archetypes of mindsets here. You can think of computational statistics as a statistical mindset that is slightly infused with the machine learning mindset.

[^still-programmed]: I find it difficult to say that the machine learns by itself. Because machine learning also requires programming. You have to implement the learning part and all the glue code to integrate the final model into the product.
