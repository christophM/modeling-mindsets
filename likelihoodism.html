<!-- CONTENT TO ADD 

* Instead of null hypothesis testing or beliefs about params, it's about testing one hypothesis over another
* Likelihoodism invites to compare models via likelihood
* Likelihoodism interprets data as evidence, not as means for making decisions [@richard2017statistical]
* Imagine researcher coming to a statistician with only 50 data points. Results look promising, but not significant. Statistician when frequentist will discourage researcher to collect more data as this will change the p-values.
* Likelihoodism is simple, objective.A
* Wenn zwei sich streiten freut sich der Dritte
* Seemingly: Frequentist is dominant, Bayesian tries to gain ground, but can't bc subjective elements. so everyone stays with weird frequentism.
* Frequentism: illogical, especially hypothesis testing. Bayes: subjective.
* Interpret likelihood ratios, not probabilities
* Likelihood ratio = strength of evidence
* "The significance-test approach to measuring the evidence is wrong because its dependence on the sample space leads to different answers in situations where the evidence is the same." [@richard2017statistical]

<!-- metaphor -->
<p>A frequentist, a Bayesian, and a likelihoodist walk into a bar, a wine bar.
The sommelier quickly joins the three.
The Bayesian wants to hear the sommelier’s opinion first before “analyzing” the data.
The frequentist asks the sommelier about the tasting procedure: Is the number of wines to taste pre-determined? Does the tasting conclude when the customer found a suitable wine? How are subsequent wines selected?
The likelihoodist politely tells the sommelier to fuck off.</p>
<!-- problem with frequentism -->
<p><a href="frequentist-inference.html#frequentist-inference">Frequentist inference</a> has a long list of limitations.
But still, it’s the dominant mindset when it comes to statistical modeling in science and elsewhere.
Bayesian analysis has seen a rise thanks to increased computational power for sampling from posteriors with MCMC.
But using subjective prior probabilities just doesn’t sit right with many people.
Could there be another way to “reform” the frequentist mindset, but without priors?
A mindset without the flawed hypothesis testing and p-values?</p>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>likelihoodist</strong> mindset.</p>
<!-- underdog -->
<p>I studied statistics for 5 years, worked as statistician and data scientist for 3 years, then did my PhD studies for 4.5 years.
In those 12 years of statistics I never learned about likelihoodism.
It’s fair to say that likelihoodism is the underdog.
Likelihoodism lurks in the shadows while Bayesianism and frequentism are having an epic fight.</p>
<!-- why learn about it -->
<p>Likelihoodism is the purist among the statistical modeling mindsets.
A mindset that completely focuses on the likelihood functions of statistical models.
Likelihoodism is an attempt to make statistics as objective as possible.
It doesn’t rely on subjective prior probabilities, like Bayesian inference does.
Frequentist inference also has a subjective component.
The intention of the analyst, like stopping criteria for collecting data, influences the frequentist’s results.
But more on that later.</p>
<!-- short reminder: likelihood -->
<p><strong>All three mindsets use likelihood functions in different ways.</strong>
A short recap: The likelihood function is the same as the data density function, but thes roles of data and parameters within the function are switched.
Data <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are “fixed”, and the likelihood is a function of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta; X) = P(X = x | \theta)\)</span>.
The likelihood bridges observed data and theoretic distributions.
<!-- use of the likelihood function -->
Bayesians use the likelihood function to update the prior of the parameters to the posterior distribution.
Frequentists use the likelihood to estimate parameters and construct “imagined” experiments that teach us about long-run frequencies, such as hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
Likelihoodists see the likelihood as evidence derived from data for a statistical hypothesis.
Likelihoodists put all the focus on the likelihood and reject the non-likelihood elements from freauentism and Bayesianism:
Likelihoodists reject priors, because they are subjective;
Likelihoodists also reject the frequentists dependence on “imagined” experiments, because they violate the likelihood principle and are, arguably, subjective as well.</p>

<!-- likelihood principle as foundation -->
<p>But what is this likelihood principle?</p>
<div id="likelihood-principle" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Likelihood Principle<a href="likelihoodism.html#likelihood-principle" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>“The likelihood principle asserts that two observations that generate identical likelihood functions are equivalent as evidence”<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-richard2017statistical" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>
As a consequence, all the evidence that comes from the data about a quantity of interest <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> has to come from the likelihood function <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta;X)\)</span>.
If we reverse the statement: If information from the data influences the analysis but is not part of the likelihood, then the likelihood principle is violated.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to estimate the average waiting time for a public bus.
The exponential distribution is typically used to model waiting times.
So we might assume that <span class="math inline">\(X \sim Exp(\lambda)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> can be interpreted as the inverse waiting time.
The expected waiting time is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\lambda}\)</span>.
We collected <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> waiting times <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_n\)</span>.
The likelihood function is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\lambda; x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \lambda^n exp\left(-\lambda \sum_{i=n}^n x^{(i)}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>In all three mindsets, it would make sense to work with this likelihood.
Bayesians would, in addition, assume a prior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.
Whether the likelihood principle is violated depends on what we do after calculating the likelihood.
Bayesians get a posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> which is interpreted as belief about the parameter.
The likelihoodist might report the likelihood region for the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> which can be interpreted as relative evidence of a range of parameter values compared to the maximum likelihood estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.
Both the Bayesian and the likelihoodist adhere to the likelihood principle:
All evidence from the data about <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is contained in the likelihood.
Bayesians use priors, but as long as they don’t contain information from the data, it’s fine. <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The frequentist might test whether the parameter is larger than a certain value.
By advising such a test, the frequentist has to “imagine” experiments under an assumed distribution under the null hypothesis.
But the null hypothesis is not part of the likelihood.
Frequentists choose the distribution under the null hypothesis based on how they “imagine” repetitions of the sampling or the experiment.
That in turn depends on how the experiment was conducted or how the data was collected in the first place.
You will later see a simple coin toss example where the same data from different experiments produce different frequentist conclusions.</p>
<!--
The likelihood principle is a consequence of 1) the sufficiency principle and 2) the conditionality principle.[@birnbaum1962foundations]
The sufficiency principle says that a sufficient statistic $S(X)$ of a quantity of interest summarizes all relevant evidence from the data.
The conditionality principles says that experiments or samples that were not performed should be ignored.
Many frequentist approaches directly violate the conditionality principle.
Statistical hypothesis tests are designed around experiments that never happen.

-->
<p>So the big difference between frequentism and likelihoodism is the likelihood principle.
The likelihood principle gives the likelihood function the monopoly over data evidence.
But the likelihood principle alone, is not enough to build a coherent modeling mindset with.</p>

<div id="law-of-likelihood" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="7.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Law of Likelihood<a href="likelihoodism.html#law-of-likelihood" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The law of likelihood is the foundation for using the likelihood function alone for modeling decisions.
The law of likelihood says<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-hacking1965logic" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given:
<ul>
<li>Hypotheses <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>; data <span class="math inline">\(X=x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Likelihood of A is larger than B: <span class="math inline">\(P_{H_1}(X=x) &gt; P_{H_2}(X=x)\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then:
<ul>
<li>Observation <span class="math inline">\(X=x\)</span> is evidence supporting <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The likelihood ratio <span class="math inline">\(P_{H_1}(x)/P_{H_2}(x)\)</span> measures the strength of that evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The hypotheses can be different parameter values for a distribution.
Going back to the bus waiting time example, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> could be that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> could be that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0.5\)</span>.
The result might be:
<span class="math display">\[P(\lambda = 1;x_1, \ldots, x_n)/P(\lambda = 0.5;x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 4\]</span>.</p>
<p>The likelihood ratio is the likelihood of one statistical hypothesis divided by the likelihood of another.
As a reminder, statistical hypotheses are like statistical models, where some or all of the parameters may be assigned by hand rather than learned from the data.
If we want to compare hypotheses <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, we can use the likelihood ratio:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{P(H_1;X)}{P(H_2;X)}\]</span></p>
<p>In frequentism likelihood ratios are often used as test statistics for hypothesis tests.
In likelihoodism, the likelihood ratio is interpreted as evidence.
As a shortcut, likelihoodists can use a rule of thumb for judging the strength of evidence.
For example, a likelihood ratio of 8 is seen as fairly strong, and 32 or more as strong favoring.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-richard2017statistical" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In our example, a likelihood ratio of 4 in favor of <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \lambda = 1\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(H_2: \lambda = 0.5\)</span> is not enough to be “fairly strong”.
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> can also be more complex hypotheses, such as regression models with different covariates or assumptions.</p>
<!-- stronger law -->
<p><strong>The law of likelihood is stronger than the likelihood principle:</strong>
The likelihood principle says that the all evidence from the data must be in the likelihood;
<strong>the law of describes how evidence can be measured.</strong>
And that’s where Bayesian inference and likelihoodism differ.
Bayesians are not guided by the law of likelihood, but by Bayesian updating.</p>
<!-- clear vision -->
<p>The law of likelihood makes it clear how we may compare statistical hypotheses:
Not with hypothesis testing, but by comparing different hypothesis using their likelihood ratios.
The larger the ratio, the stronger the evidence for one hypothesis over another.</p>
<!-- shortcomings -->
<p>Unfortunately, the likelihoodism mindset doesn’t entail guidance for belief or action.
The likelihood ratio can say which hypothesis is favored.
But the likelihood ratio can’t tell us whether the evidence is enough to make decision for a hypothesis over another.
The likelihood ratio also doesn’t reflect a degree of belief about the parameters.</p>

### Voltmeter Story {-}

CONTINUE HERE

There is a famous story by TODO.
It's about a frequentist statistician, and about changing the inference based on imagined experiments.

* An engineer measures voltages of electron tubes. The results range from 30V to 99V.
* The statistician computes mean and 95% confidence interval of the measurements.
* Later the statistician finds out that the voltmeter only goes to 100 Volts. Censored data. That means that the analysis has to change. The statistician cannot assume a Gaussian, but has to assume a distribution that is cut off at 100. Like a trimmed Gaussian.
* So far, also the likelihoodist would agree (except that they wouldn't compute confidence intervals).  
* But then the engineer also says that she has another voltmeter that goes to 1000 Volt. If the other voltmeter had maxed out, she would have switched to the 1000V one.
* Alright, back to the non-censored analysis from the beginning. I think here every type of statistician would also agree.
* A few day later it turns out that the 1000V voltmeter was broken. And the engineer admits that in that case she wouldn't have waited with the measurements and just reported 100V.     
* For the likelihoodist, this new information doesn't change anything. In this one experiment, no measurement maxed out, so the analysis can stay the same.
* The frequentist faces a more complex modeling problem now, because the imagined future experiment are now weirdly conditional on the probability that the 1000V voltmeter works.
* Remember the confidence interval interpretation: "Would we repeat the experiment multiple times, the confidence interval has a 95% chance to cover the true mean. With this new information about the experiment ("would have reported the censored measurements if 1000V voltmeter broken") the confidence interval has to involve the probability. 
* Repeating the experiment now involves the probability of the 1000V voltmeter working. It's a mixture of two distributions: If the 1000V device works the statistician would model the data with a Gaussian distribution. If 1000V voltmeter is broken, the statistician would model the data with a trimmed Gaussian distribution.
* This couldn't even be estimated, since we don't know the probability that it works or not, and also can't estimate it.
* It's an ugly situation.
* Truth to be told. Most frequentist statistician would be pragmatic enough to ignore it and just decide for the uncensored model and pretend that this is what the future "imagined" experiments look like.
* Nonetheless, there are still 3 options for confidence interval with different interpretations in the end.
* The experimental setup decide on how to do analysis

## Modeling and Likelihood Ratios

When likelihoodists build models, it is very similar to how frequentist build their models.
The big difference is in the interpetation of the models and how likehoodists deal with results.
Or rather, it's in what likelihoodists do NOT do.
Likelihoodists reject the idea of long-run frequences as the frequentists rely on.
This also means that likelihoodists don't use hypothesis tests, p-value, confidence intervals and so on.
Likelihoodists also reject the Bayesian interpretation of probability.
They can't rely on posterior distributions, and their interpretation as beliefs about the parameters.
How then, can likelihoodists say anything about the world with their models?

When all is contained in the likelihood, then it is obvious that we should be comparing likelihoods.
For likelihoodists, building a model means creating a hypothesis.
The hypothesis can be: Daily vitamin D intake reduces the number of colds per year.
An alternative hypothesis could be: Daily vitamin D intake reduces the number of colds per year, but also whether the person is a couch potatoe or very active.
Both hypotheses can be modelled.
Let's say $Y$ is the number of colds, $X_1$ is the binary information whether someone takes vitamin D (yes/no) and $X_2$ the random variable representing whether the person is a couch potatoe (potatoe/active). 
As the outcome is a count, the statistician chooses a Poisson distribution for the outcome:

$$Y | X_1, X_2 \sim Poi(\lambda)$$ 

The parameter $\lambda$ describes the intensity of how often colds occur.  
To connect the random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ with the outcome, we say that the expected outcome is a function of the random variables.

$$E(Y | X_1, X_2) = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1}$$

That's for the first model, where we only have vitamin D as variable.
The other model also contains another variable:

$$E(Y | X_1, X_2) = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2}$$

Both can then be optimized with a maximum likelihood appraoch, as presented in [chapter statistical modeling](#statistical-modeling).
This gives us the best fitting parameters.
But it gives us something else as well.
And we haven't talked about it yet.
We get the likelihood.
Which is a number that can be interpreted as the likelihood of the model and its parameterization.
This means for our made-up example, we get two models with different parameter estimates and also two likelihood numbers.

This brings us to likelihood ratios.
It's a simple equation: We divide the likelihood of model for hypothesis $H_1$ by the likelihood of model hypothesis $H_2$:

$$\frac{L(H_1|X)}{L(H_2|X)}$$

This allows one to compare the likelihood of two hypothesis.
A likelihood ratio larger than 1 favors $H_1$, a ratio smaller than 1 favors $H_2$.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Likelihood Intervals<a href="likelihoodism.html#likelihood-intervals" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<!-- using likelihood intervals -->
<p>Likelihood intervals or regions are the likelihoodist analogue to frequentist confidence interval and Bayesian credible intervals.
The interpretation of likelihood regions is in terms of, you guessed it, relative likelihood.
The likelihood interval of a model parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (like a coefficient in a linear model) is the set of all <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> values that yield a relative likelihood greater than a certain threshold:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left\{\theta: \frac{L(\theta| X)}{L(\hat{\theta}| X)} \geq \frac{p}{100}\right\}\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta}\)</span> is the “optimal” parameter that the modeler found using maximum likelihood (or a similar optimization method).
Let’s say for a logistic regression model coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_j = 1.1\)</span>. <!-- fix vim_ -->
Then an interval might be <span class="math inline">\([0.9; 1.3]\)</span>.
The constant <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is similar to the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-level for confidence and credible intervals:
It sets the size of the region.
See Figure <a href="likelihoodism.html#fig:likelihood-interval">7.2</a>.
Any point within that interval can be seen as a different hypothesis.
And these hypotheses are compared to the hypothesis with the model that <span class="math inline">\(\theta = \hat{\theta}\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Why Frequentism Violates the Likelihood Principle<a href="likelihoodism.html#why-frequentism-violates-the-likelihood-principle" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Many frequentist methods violate the likelihood principle because they require “imagined” experiments.
Experiments that never happened.
But we need these theoretic distribution to compute, for example, p-values.
Statistical null hypothesis testing is also dependent on stopping criteria for collecting data, which is in conflict with the likelihood principle.</p>
<!-- motivation for example -->
<p>The following example shows how frequentism violates the likelihood principle based on stopping criteria.
It’s also a great illustration of the core idea of likelihoodism.</p>
<!-- starting coin example -->
<p>Suppose we have a coin.
We want to figure out whether it’s fair, or whether maybe head turns up too often.
We’ll call <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> the probability of head.
We have two hypotheses:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \theta = 0.5 \text{ and } H_1: \theta &gt; 0.5\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> means the coin is fair.
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> claims that head comes up more often than tail.
We define two random variables: the number of heads <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and the number of coin tosses <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> .</p>
<!-- two types of experiments -->
<p>We conduct two experiments with a different setup, but with the same results:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Toss the coin 12 times. We observe 9 heads out of the 12 tosses.</li>
<li>Toss the coin until tail is observed 3 times. The third tail appears on the 12-th toss.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both experiments have the exact same outcome, but we defined the stopping criteria for the experiments differently:
In experiment 1) we fixed the number of tosses <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.
In experiment 2) we fixed the number of heads <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.
Should we both experiments come to different conclusions about the fairness of the coin?
What do you think?</p>
<!-- likelihoodist view of the experiment -->
<p>Both experiments produce the same likelihood, up to a constant factor. Experiment 1):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L(\theta | X = 3) = \binom{12}{3} \theta^3 (1 - \theta)^9  = 220 \theta^3 (1 - \theta)^9 \]</span></p>
<p>And experiment 2):</p>
<!-- the 2 out of 11 results from the fact that the last toss must be a head -->
<p><span class="math display">\[L(\theta | Y = 12) = \binom{11}{2} \theta^3 (1 - \theta)^9  = 55 \theta^3 (1 - \theta)^9\]</span></p>
<p>So the likelihoodists say that both experiments carry the same evidence.
And they would get the same likelihood intervals for both experiments, for example.</p>
<!-- Frequentist view on the experiments -->
<p>Frequentists would come to different conclusions depending on the experiment.
Frequentists incorporate results that did not happen, but are dependent on how the experiments are conducted.
For both hypotheses tests, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is framed as getting a more extreme event than the one observed, both in the direction of a higher probability for heads.
But we never observed more extreme events.
We just take what we observed (9 times head) and pretend that we observe the event more often.
What “more extreme” means depends on whether we are in experiment 1) or 2).<br />
When the number of tosses is fixed, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> includes probabilities of fictional experiments where 9,11, or 12 heads were observed.
In the other experiment, the number of tails is fixed.
More extreme in experiment 2) means all possible experiments where we observe more than 12 tosses.
Which includes, for example that we tossed it 10234 times.
Remember that number of tails <span class="math inline">\(X = 3\)</span> is fixed: more repetitions means that <span class="math inline">\(\theta &gt; 0.5\)</span> is more likely.</p>
<p>When testing <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> in experiment 1), we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X \geq 9| H_0) = \sum_{x = 9}^{12} \binom{x}{12} 0.5^x (1 - 0.5)^{12 - x} = 0.073\]</span></p>
<p>For a significance level of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> we would not reject the hypothesis of a fair coin.</p>
<p>For experiment 2) we assume a negative Binomial distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y \geq 9 | H_0) = \sum_{y=9}^{\infty}\binom{3 + y - 1}{2} 0.5^y 0.5^3 = 0.0327\]</span></p>
<p>The p-value is now smaller than 0.05, and with that the coin is significantly unfair.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Stopping Criteria<a href="likelihoodism.html#stopping-criteria" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This is becoming a bashing for frequentist inference.
For frequentist inference, how data are sampled and how the experiments were designed has an influence on the results.</p>
<p>This has much more subtle consequences than I’ve illustrated so far.
Imagine you are a statistician, and a domain expert asks you to do an analysis with 1000 data points.
As a frequentist, you need to know how these 1000 data points were collected.
What was the stopping criterion?
If the domain expert just planned to collect 1000, that’s fine.
But if the expert would say that, depending on the outcome of the analysis, she would collect even more data, than this changes the analysis, in a violation of the likelihood principle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Likelihoodism inherits all strengths of statistical models.</li>
<li>It’s a coherent modeling approach: all information is contained in the likelihood. Frequentism, in contrast, is rather fragmented with different approaches such as statistical tests and confidence intervals.</li>
<li>Like Bayesian inference, likelihoodist inference conforms to the likelihood principle. Therefore both are not affected by experimental design like frequentism is.</li>
<li>Arguably, likelihoodism is the most objective of the statistical modeling mindsets. No priors, no imagined experiments.</li>
<li>Likelihoodist ideas can enhance the reporting of Bayesian results. For example, Bayesians can additionally report likelihood ratios as evidence.</li>
<li>A significance test might reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, even though the evidence for <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is larger than for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>. Likelihoodism doesn’t have this problem.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Limitations<a href="likelihoodism.html#limitations-3" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Likelihoodism doesn’t give guidance in the form of belief or decision. Evidence is less practical, and the statistician has no clear answer on which model to work with. This is the strongest argument against likelihoodism, and maybe the reason why we don’t see it in practice.</li>
<li>With a likelihoodist mindset, we can can only compare specific hypotheses where all parameters are specified. Compound hypotheses for ranges of parameters are impossible. Likelihoodism can’t compare <span class="math inline">\(\theta &gt; 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(\theta \leq 0\)</span>. Only, for example <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 1\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 0\)</span>.</li>
<li>Likelihoodism allows only relative claims. It can’t give the probability that some statistical hypothesis is true – only how its evidence compares to another hypothesis.</li>
