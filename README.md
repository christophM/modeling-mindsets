## Summary

The Modeling Mindset book introduces different mindsets of learning models from data.
Each of the mindsets enhances your own mind and makes you a better modeler:

* Frequentist inference: learning about nature's "true" values.
* Bayesian inference: updating your beliefs about the world.
* Supervised machine learning: predicting new data well.
* Causal inference: taking causality seriously.
* Deep learning: embedding the world into a neural network.
* And many more. 

Modeling Mindsets opens the door to all these different ways of thinking. The book is packed with intuitive explanations and striking illustrations.
Quickly get an overview of the strengths and the limitations of each modeling mindset.
Expand your mind when it comes to modeling the world using data.

## Contributing

If you find a typo, a wrong statement, an insufficient explanation, I'd be happy to know about it.
