<!-- summary of Bayesian inference -->
<p>Bayesian inference sees the world as parameterized distributions.
To learn about the world, we have to learn about the best fitting parameters.
But for Bayesians, the parameters themselves are random variables with a probability distribution.
So to learn about the parameters, we have to assume some prior distribution, and update our belief about the our parameters with data.
This is then the posteriori distribution.</p>
<!-- relation to others -->
<p>Bayesian inference is a likelihood-based apprach that builds on the Bayes theorem:
The distribution parameters do not only depend on the data, but we assume some prior distribution.
In Bayesian statistics, probability can be interpreted as the plausibility of an event.
Bayesian statistics is about the degree of beliefs we have about our parameters.
Bayesianism is therefore found on the idea of subjective probabilities.
If you haven’t read the <a href="statistical-inference.html#statistical-inference">chapter on statistical inference</a>, I recommend you do it first, since Bayesian inference is easier understood when you have a good grasp on statistical inference.
The core difference to frequentism are: Heavy use of Bayes’ theorem; assumption of prior distribution of parameters; interpretation of probability as degrees of beliefs and not as long-run frequencies.</p>
<!-- Bayesian updating -->
<p>Bayesian inference is about changing your mind.
We update our knowledge about the world when new information comes in.
You already know some stuff to the world.
Prior to getting some new information.
Then you update your knowledge, based on data / evidence.
Then you go about your life with this udpated knowledge.</p>
<!-- Example of knowledge update in real life -->
<p>Imagine you are at a snack machine.
You have a general idea how much you like snack machines.
You rate most snack vending machines 6/10 - 9/10.
Without further knowledge, you would expect the new machine that you just encountered to be somewhere in that range too.
But this newly installed machine is directly at the train station, and it has your favorite chips.
So you give it a rating of 9/10.
But then two big betrayals.
First, the chips got stuck one day, between the tray and the window pane.
This happens, but it’s always very annoying.
But directly the day after, the machine refused to give you change.
These betrayals made you change your rating to 5/10.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Bayes Theorem<a href="bayesian.html#bayes-theorem" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<!-- Bayes' theorem has many applications -->
<p>At the very center of Bayesian inference is the Bayes’ theorem.
The Bayes’ theorem expresses a conditional probability in terms of other probabilities.
As such, the theorem has many applications.</p>
<!-- The Bayes' theorem -->
<p>In the case of Bayesian modelling, we are interested in the distribution of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> conditional on the data <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta | D)\)</span>.
So far, equivalent to <a href="#frequentism">frequentism</a> and <a href="likelihoodism.html#likelihoodism">likelihoodism</a>, with the difference that Bayesians explicitly say that the model parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are random variables and therefore have probability distributions.
To
Applying the Bayes’ theorem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{P(\theta|D)}_{\text{posteriori}} = \frac{\overbrace{P(D | \theta)}^{\text{likelihood}} \cdot  \overbrace{P(\theta)}^{\text{priori}}}{\underbrace{P(D)}_{\text{evidence}}}\]</span></p>
<p>The Bayes’ theorem in the context of Bayesian inference contains the idea of belief updates, as also visualized in Figure <a href="bayesian.html#fig:bayesian">6.1</a>.
<span class="math inline">\(P(\theta)\)</span>, also called the prior, is the probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> before we have collected any data.
The probability distribution gets updated by multiplying the prior with the likelihood <span class="math inline">\(P(D | \theta)\)</span> of the data.
This product is scaled by the probability of the data <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span>, also called evidence.
The result is the posteriori probability distribution, an updated belief about our parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.1: Illustration of priori density that gets an update from the likelihood of the data to result in posteriori probability distribution.
</p>
</div>
<p>Next, let’s dive deeper into the individual components of the Bayes’ theorem, so that we can update our own beliefs about Bayesianism.</p>
</div>
<div id="prior-probability" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Prior Probability<a href="bayesian.html#prior-probability" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<!-- prerequisites -->
<p>The Bayes’ theorem tells us that we have to know <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta)\)</span> to calculate the posterior probability distribution.
This implies that the model parameters themselves are random variables, or otherwise <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta)\)</span> is a meaningless statement.
For example, the mean of a distribution has a distribution itself.
Let’s sat we randomly choose a person and want to know how long they worked today.
The number of daily working hours, the random variable of interest, follow some probability distribution that have parameters.
For example, it might follow a Gaussian distribution, which is described with mean and variance parameters.
Bayesians would assume that the mean parameter is itself a random variable.</p>
<!-- how to pick a prior -->
<p>How would we know how the model parameter is distributed, when we haven’t even observed any data yet?
Bayesians assume some prior distribution.
The factors going into the choice of prior distribution are manifold.
<!-- parameter space reasons -->
The clearest factor are constraints on the space the parameter lives in:
Is the parameter the mean of distribution? Then we need a continuous distribution, for example Gaussian.
Maybe you know that the mean is positive, so you pick a prior distribution that only contains positive values, for example the Gamma distribution.
<!-- expert knowledge reasons -->
Furthermore, expert knowledge can be used to inform the choice.
Maybe we know from other experiments that the mean of the data distribution should be near 1.
So we could assume a Normal distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\theta \sim N(1, 1)\)</span>.
In the case of Binomial distribution of your data, for binary outcomes, the Beta distribution is a good prior (see Figure <a href="bayesian.html#fig:priors">6.2</a>).
Depending on your belief about the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> you might choose a very different parameteriziation of the Beta distribution.
Maybe you belief the parameter to be symmetrically distributed around 0.5.
Or maybe the parameter is more drawn to 0.25?
Another Beta prior might put emphasis on <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> being one.
<!-- intuition for alpha = beta = 0.5: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/362728/whats-the-intuition-for-a-beta-distribution-with-alpha-and-or-beta-less-than -->
But it’s also possible to have a prior that puts most probability on 0 and 1 symmetrically.
When there are no specific prior beliefs about the parameter the Bayesian can use an “uninformative” or “objective” priors, meaning <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<!-- convenience reasons -->
Another factor is mathematical convenience.
It’s convenient to pick conjugate priors.
A convenient case is using conjugate priors.
Conjugate priors are probability distributions that remain of the same family when combined with certain likelihood functions.
Suppose you model your data as Bernoulli distribution, which describes the distribution as probabilities of being 1 with probability of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and 0 otherwise.Then we measure a realization <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of this Bernoulli random variable.
Further, if we assume to have a Beta distribution as prior distribution, then we also have a beta posteriori function.</p>
<!-- priors are criticized -->
<p>The reliance on choosing prior probability functions is the Achilles’ heel of Bayesianism, or at least the biggest target of critique.
The subjective choice of a prior probability influences all results coming from Bayesian inference.
It clashes especially with the frequentist mindset that there is some true and constant parameters out there.
And frequentist aim to be very objective, by only operating on long-run frequencies.
Also likelihoodism says that all information is in the likelihood, which clashes with the idea of a prior distribution influencing the outcome.</p>
<!-- don't exagerate -->
<p>However, there are two major objections to this criticism.
First, the more data we have, the less influential the prior distribution becomes.
And second, the prior is not hidden or anything, influencing the analysis from the shadows.
Let’s say two experts disagree on which prior to use.
You can run Bayesian inference twice, and compare the results.</p>
<p>To get to the posterior likelihood of our parameters, our ultimate goal in Bayesian inferene, we have to update our prior belief with data, or rather: the likelihood function.</p>

<div id="likelihood" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Likelihood<a href="bayesian.html#likelihood" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<!-- likelihood recap -->
<p>If you have read the <a href="statistical-modeling.html#statistical-modeling">chapter about statistical modeling</a>, you should be familiar with the likelihood function <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta | D)\)</span>.
The likelihood is the probability function of the data, but with a twist:
We switch the role of data and parameters.
The probability function is a function of the data: We put in a data point and the probability function tells us how probable this data point is. Parameters are assumed to be fixed.
The likelihood function is a function of the parameters: We put in the model parameters, and it tells us how likely the observed data is. Data are assumed to be fixed.</p>
<!-- where does the likelihood come from -->
<p>To get to the likelihood, we have to make assumptions about how our data is distributed.
Like any <a href="statistical-modeling.html#statistical-modeling">statistical model</a>!
So we assume parameterized distributions for our data and turn it into a maximization problem: Finding the right parameter that maximize the likelihood.
That’s true at least for <a href="#frequentism">frequentism</a> and <a href="likelihoodism.html#likelihoodism">likelihoodism</a>.
But for Bayesians, it’s just part of the equation.
But if you are already familiar with likelihoods and so on, then this part of the Bayesian mindset should be very familiar to you.
Another part of the equation is the evidence <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span>, but as we will see, it does not matter that much:</p>
</div>
<div id="evidence" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Evidence<a href="bayesian.html#evidence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The evidence is the marginalized probability of our data.
It’s sometimes called model evidence.
Marginalized means that we integrate over all possible parameter values.
It’s a bit difficult to interpret, but that’s not a problem at all.
Due to the marginalization, <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span> does not depend on the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> at all.
Which means that in terms of maximizing the posterior probability, it’s just a constant factor.
As we will see later on, we can work around <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span>.
We don’t have to compute it to get to the posterior probability.
But it means that we have to employ sampling techniques instead of computing the posterior directly.
That’s why the posterior probability is often written as being proportional to the numerator:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{P(\theta|D)}_{\text{posteriori}} \propto \overbrace{P(D | \theta)}^{\text{likelihood}} \cdot  \underbrace{P(\theta)}_{\text{priori}}\]</span></p>
<p>So, how do we finally estimate the posterior probability?</p>

<!-- Goal of Bayesian -->
<p>The goal of the Bayesian is to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters.
Once they have that, they can interpret those distributions, make predictions with the model, draw conclusions.</p>
<!-- Problem: Posterior estimation -->
<p>But how do we estimate the posterior?
Ideally you’d want to have a closed form expression to calculate the posterior.
That’s possible in simple cases, for example when you used conjugate priors.
But in many modelling cases, it’s not possible to get a closed form expression to calculate the posterior probability distribution.
The problem here is the <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span>.
The evidence is too difficult to compute.
Not only is <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span> a problem:
Also there can be many parameters, and we have a high-dimensional optimization problem.
So we need to be clever about optimizing it.</p>
<!-- Don't solve exactly, but sample -->
<p>We don’t HAVE to compute it.
Another option is to just sample from it.
Special sampling techniques from the posterior distribution is the go-to solution to fit the posterior distribution.
A method called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is typically employed for this sampling task</p>
<!-- shortest MCMC explanation -->
<p>We start with some initial values for our parameters.
Then new parameter values are proposed.
This requires some prooposal function.
These new values are either accepted or rejected, based on prior and likelihood.
If jump is accepted, adapt parameters.
In any case, go back to step 2 of new parameter proposals.
The process is repeated many times, and produces a “chain” of samples for each of the parameters.</p>
<!-- MCMC interpretation -->
<!-- https://twiecki.io/blog/2015/11/10/mcmc-sampling/ -->
<p>How does MCMC make any sense?
During the “jumping” between parameters, we are actually comparing models.
This if the acceptance function.
The comparison happens by dividing the posteriors of the model with “old” parameter values and the one with the newly proposed parameter values.
The evidence <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span> cancels out.</p>
<!-- from sample to distributions -->
<p>We cannot use the entire chain as samples from the posteriori distribution.
First, the first view samples are likely far away from the true posteriori and should therfore be “burned”, meaning you ignore them.
So, maybe the first 1000 of samples are thrown away.
Then, you want independent samples.
But the samples in the chain are dependent on the ones that come before them.
So we have to sample from the chain, and make sure that there are enough values between the samples.
There are diagnosis tools to do this, but we won’t go into the details here.
Then you have samples from your posterior distribution.
Those you can visualize with histogram or density plots.</p>
<!-- more to know about MCMC -->
<p>There are many other more sophisticated sampling methods, but for this introduction it is good enough to show MCMC.
Gibbs sampler, Metropolis-Hastings, …
All have in common that they are computationally expensive.
So a big part of the daily job as a Bayesian is to wait for those MCMC chains to converge.
At least compared to a frequentist.</p>
<p>A shorter alternative is variational inference <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
But while MCMC deliver approximately exact estimates of the posterior probability, variational inference is more of a heuristic.</p>

<!-- raising questions about inference -->
<p>As said before, getting the posterior distribution is the core of Bayesian mindset.
What can we then do with the posterior probability?
What insights can be drawn from the posterior, and how do we link it with the world?</p>
<!-- statistical model -->
<p>Remember that Bayesians build <a href="statistical-modeling.html#statistical-modeling">statistical models</a>:
So they try to approximate the data-generating process with a construct of probability distributions of random variables.
These distributions are parameterized, and Bayesians say that these parameters are random variable themselves.
Also, Bayesians think of probability as degrees of belief.
The posterior represents an updated belief about the parameters that represent the real world.</p>
<!-- learning about the world -->
<p>A parameter might reveal to us the distribution of the treatment effect of a cancer drug.
Or a parameter represents the probability distribution of the mean size of a person.
Visualizing the posterior distributions fully reveals the information that we have.
But there are plenty of options as well to summarize the posterior distributions:</p>
<p>TODO: finish up figure with credible interval, mean</p>

FIGURE 6.3: Describing the posterior distribution.
</p>
</div>
<!-- options to describe the distribution -->
<p>Maximum a posteriori estimation: This is the mode (the highest point) of the posteriori distribution. It represents the most likely value.
But there are other summaries:
You could just compute the mean or the median of the posterior probability distribution.
Or any other quantile of the distribution.
Another option are credible intervals.</p>
<!-- Credible interval -->
<p>In frequentist statistics, we get confidence intervals for our estimators.
That’s some uncertainty quantifycation telling us how sure we are about our estimation.
But it’s different with Bayesian inference.
Since we get posterior probabilities for our parameters, and from the we can derive credibility or credible intervals.
For example, a 95% credibility interval contains 95% of the mass of our parameter.
With 95% probability, the parameter falls within that interval.
Not in the sense that there is some fixed value for the parameter.
But it’s a random variable that can take on different values.
Technically, they work the same as confidence intervals in frequentist statistics.
But they have a different philosophical interpretation.</p>
<!-- Bayesian prediction -->
<ul>
<li>Since the parameters have a distribution, also the prediction is not just a point-wise prediction.</li>
<li>posterior predictive distribution: The distribution for a newly predicted data point. To get there, we have to marginalize over the posterior</li>
<li>IN frequentist statistis, the uncertainty of the model parameters is not regarded in the prediction f a new data point. So it underestimates the variability of the prediction.</li>
<li>There is also a prior predictive distribution: It’s the distribution for a newly predicted data point. But instead of marginalized</li>
<li></li>

## Some Examples of Bayesian inference

What would a linear regression model look like in the Bayesian modeling approach?

For that we have to assume that $Y$ follows a Gaussian distribution given $X$.
The Bayesian mindset tells us that we are interested in the distribution of the parameters of this model.
In this model, the relationship between the mean of the distribution of $Y$ and the features are represented by the model coefficients $\mathbf{\beta}$.

So we would assume that y folllows a Normal distribution:

$$y \sim N(\mathbf{\beta}^TX, \sigma^2 I)$$

Since we are in the Bayesian mindset, we also assume a distribution for the parameters $\mathbf{\beta}$ and $\sigma$.

This you can see by looking at how we would get the posterior probability:

$$P(\beta|Y,X) = \frac{P(y|\beta,X) P(\beta|X)}{P(y|X)}$$

* $P(y|X)$ is the data evidence
* $P(\beta|X)$ is the prior probability for $\beta$
* $P(y|\beta, X)$ is the likelihood function
* $P(\beta|y,X)$ is the posteriori probability of the model parameters

We carry arround the $X$ in the formulas the entire time in the conditioning statement.
This is allowed.

<ul>
<li>Bayesianism allows to make use of prior knowledge.</li>
<li>Priors are especially useful when expert knowledge has to be included in the approach.</li>
<li>Bayesian inference inherits all advantages of <a href="statistical-modeling.html#statistical-modeling">statistical models</a>.</li>
<li>Bayesianism offers an expressive language to build up models</li>
<li>A natural propagation of variance if, for example, there are uncertainties in the measurement</li>
<li>A natural appraoch for hierarchical or multilevel modeling.</li>
<li>Allows a holistic probabilistic approach: Through Bayes’ theorem, parameters and data can be chained into a probabilistic model. General solver programs can then automatically derive the posterior estimates using MCMC. Everything is random variable: data and parameters. Everything is tied together by probabilistic operations.</li>
<li>Thinking like a Bayesian makes you aware of DGP, uncertainties in your parameters, full probability models. Even more than in the frequentist mindset.</li>
<li>As a more general benefit: Bayesianism is a great mental mdoel for how we update our own hypotheses about the world.</li>
<li>Arguable a more intuitive interpretation of probability: When practitioners make a wrong interpretation of frequentist confidence interval, what they actually do is interpret them as credible intervals. The interpretation of Bayesian probbility is easier: I believe / it’s likely that the parameter is in this area.</li>
<li>Decoupling of inference and decision. You can first learn those posteriors, and then apply logic to make decision with this inference. Like MAP and credible intervals.</li>
